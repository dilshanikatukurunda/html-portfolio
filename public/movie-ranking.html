<h1>The Best Movies According to Sandamila</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Aladdin</h3>
<p>Aladdin" is a very funny and highly entertaining version of the Arabian NightsÂ´ tale.</p>
<h3>Back to the future</h3>
<p>It's great sci-fi, and terrific family entertainment.</p>
<h3>Harry Potter- The Half-blood Prince</h3>
<p> It is an exercise in minimalism and showing only what is necessary to the plot. Condensing the novel better than ever done before, Kloves has given Yates the tools to make a film and not just a visual representation of the words.</p>
